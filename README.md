# Ephemerism

Ephemerism's music is blend of ambient textures with hypnotic and dreamy guitar melodies.
The project is based in Brussels, Belgium.

## Hazy Memories

I am pleased to announce the release of Ephemerism's first EP, _Hazy Memories_. The EP was
conceived during a two-week long retreat in the Belgian countryside during an unseasonably
cold spring.

In Belgium, nature is always close, but civilization is never far away. The inspiration
for the tracks in this EP is humanity's conflicted relationship with nature. "Hazy
Memories" features a hypnotic and somber guitar amongst a backdrop of deep and
contemplative sounds.

major streaming services.
